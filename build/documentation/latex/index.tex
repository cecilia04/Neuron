This program simulates a cortex of 12500 neurons. 12 000 neurons are excitatory and 2 500 are inhibitory. Each neurons have 1 000 excitatory and 250 inhibitory connections

The program will run 4 simulations with different parameters in order to draw plots. In order to draw the plot for the simulation i\+: Run the command in the terminal \+: python graphi.\+py

Data for the simulation i are available in the fil Expi.\+csv
